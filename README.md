# Introduction
The Notes Application is tailored to address the daily challenge of capturing information swiftly in a fast-paced environment where pulling out pen and paper isn't feasible. It facilitates the process of recording information from various sources or events, encompassing writing, snapping, abbreviating, scanning, labeling, clarifying, and defining. Developed using the MERN stack, this web-based application enables users to seamlessly type notes on their mobile devices, mimicking the experience of writing on paper with traditional note-taking apps. # React + Vite
